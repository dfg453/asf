FAQ
---

Q. What is the purpose of the Help Bubbles option?

The "Help Bubbles" option turns on or off the little "yummy" thought bubbles
that appear for a few seconds when you first start a level or when you grow in
size. They let you know which new types of fish you can eat at your new size.

Q. What is the Food Bank for?

The Food Bank keeps track of all the fish you've eaten in New Game mode. As
you fill up your food bank, you will earn Feeding Frenzy screen savers! Can you
unlock all 6 screen savers?

There is only one Food Bank score. However, on machines such as those running
Windows XP that support multiple user profiles, each profile will have its own
Food Bank score.

Q. Is my Food Bank stuck? It stopped at 10 million points.

Although you will still see how many Food Bank points you earned at the end of
levels in New Game mode, the most you can store is 10 million.  In other words,
the amount shown in the High Scores screen won't count up past 10 million.

Q. How can I turn on a screen saver that I've unlocked?

On your Windows desktop, right-click and choose Properties, select the "Screen
Saver" tab, then select FeedingFrenzy from the drop-down list of screen savers.

To pick which screen saver to activate, click the "Settings" button and a
window will appear showing which screen savers you've unlocked. Select a screen
saver and click the "Done" button.

To preview the selected screen saver, click the "Preview" button. When you're
done, click "OK" to save your settings. Your Feeding Frenzy screen saver should
now be activated.

Q. Can I save the game in Timed Mode?

Feeding Frenzy doesn't support game saves in Timed Mode ... only New Game mode.

Q. How do I start a new game from scratch?  

After selecting New Game, simply click the first red dot (the one right next to
the angelfish) to start from the first level of the game with no score.


Gameplay Instructions
---------------------

CONTROLS:

Play Feeding Frenzy with your mouse. Use your mouse to move your fish through
the water. To eat fish that are smaller than you, simply maneuver so that your
mouth is near your victim. Your fish will automatically gobble up its prey.

Click the Left Mouse Button for a quick burst of speed. Once you’ve acquired
the ability, click your Right Mouse Button to suck in a big gulp of water, and
all the nearby fish!

GAMEPLAY BASICS:

The deep sea is a treacherous place. In order to get your lunch, you’re going
to need to be swift and avoid all the predators.

At the top of the screen is your growth chart which indicates the current menu
of fish that you can safely eat. Eat fish that are smaller than you by swimming
towards them. Avoid fish that are larger than you, or you'll become lunch!

The more you eat, the bigger you’ll grow. As you grow, your menu will include
more and more fish. Reaching the top of the food chain allows you to to move on
to the next level.

Can you grow big enough to become an Orca and face the Shark King?

GAME MODES:

There are two game modes in Feeding Frenzy: New Game and Time Attack.

There is no time pressure in NEW GAME mode. Simply eat and eat until you get
to the top of the food chain. As you progress, you will unlock new fish on your
way to the open ocean. The game continues until you lose all your lives, or
until you defeat the Shark King!

In NEW GAME mode, Feeding Frenzy saves your progress every time you clear a
stage. If you quit the game or reach GAME OVER, you can start a new game from
any stage that you have already completed.

In TIME ATTACK mode, it's a race against the clock. In this mode, you have
unlimited lives, but if the time attack clock runs out, the game is over. The
time remaining on the clock for each stage rolls over to the subsequent one, so
try to complete stages as quickly as possible. See how far you can make it
without running out of time!

HINTS, TIPS AND BONUSES:

- Every fish you eat fills up your Frenzy meter a little; however, the meter
empties slowly over time if you don't keep eating. To fill up the meter, try to
eat fish as quickly as possible. Fill the meter and you will enter a "Feeding
Frenzy." While in a Feeding Frenzy, all point values are worth double their
normal value! Fill up the meter a second time for a "Double Frenzy" and a 3X
score multiplier! Feeding Frenzy multipliers are a great way to rack up points.

- If you complete a stage without losing a life, the MERMAID will appear and
shower you with bonus star fish bubbles.

- Don't worry if you get eaten or defeated in a bonus stage. Losing a life in a
bonus stage doesn't actually cost you one of your lives.

- Not sure if you're big enough to eat a fish? Check out the MENU in the upper
left corner of the screen. Fish that appear in the menu are safe to eat.

- Look out for the very rare GOLDEN MINNOW. These magical minnows are fast, but
if you manage to catch one, you'll automatically grow to your next size!

- Every once in a while you can find BLACK PEARLS or 1-UP bonuses in an oyster.
Keep an eye out for these special bonuses!

- If you eat a POISON MINNOW, you will become poisoned and turn green. While
poisoned, the controls on your fish will be reversed! To shake off the effects
of the poison, quickly tap the Left Mouse Button.

- In NEW GAME mode, you will earn an extra life at 6,000 points, 12,000 points,
and then every 12,000 points after that.


Troubleshooting
---------------

This software has been tested extensively to make sure it will operate
correctly for all users. If you experience system crashes, error messages or
other incorrect behavior, we suggest you first try one of the following:

1) Upgrade your computer's sound card drivers. This can be done by identifying
the type of sound card your computer is using and finding the manufacturer's web
site. Or, most drivers will be automatically updated if you follow step #2.

2) Upgrade DirectX. This is a Microsoft component and it includes special
drivers for video cards and sound cards for virtually every manufacturer. It is
therefore a very large download, but updating DirectX solves nearly all system
problems encountered with GameHouse games.
